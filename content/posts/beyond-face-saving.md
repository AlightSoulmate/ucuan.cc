Only by letting go of the need to "save face" can one truly break free from all the mental struggles. Anxious stems from an excessive desire for control; depression arises from an obsessive pursuit of success; compulsive behavior is trapped in the demand for perfection; social anxiety is bound by a deep craving for external validation.

Adhere to longtermism, refuse self-attack, and dare to challenge the unknown. Think about problems in the long term, view them from a developmental perspective, understand everything comprehensively, and break free from the limitations of thinking.

Success requires luck, but the arrival of luck is based on a certain foundation. Since I can't leave here, I'll first build up my full ability to stand firm here.
