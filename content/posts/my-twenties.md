Having a stable job with a considerable salary in the future - this goal doesn't seem very difficult to achieve, but I often feel anxious about it.

As the second child in the family, I always to be the one being taken care of, even in my twenties. Meantime, I can always obtain more care than my elder sister from our parents under the preference for sons over daughters in their minds. Moreover, while being care of for a long time, I am bound to be subject to more constraints. So my teenage experiences were also the reason why I wanted to work and live in a distant place in the future.

In China, many people have an obsession with making a name for themselves, which has enabled some lower-class people to successfully achieve social mobility while others entrust this mission to their children. I once solemnly took on this mission, but now I feel afraid that I may not even be able to surpass the social status and salary of my father and mother. I attribute it to the following reasons:

1. A not-so-mature mind.
2. An extremely ordinary bachelor's degree.
3. A not-so-high emotional intelligence.
4. A introverted nature.
5. A non-stable emotion.
6. A no acute insight into business opportunity.
7. An insufficient concentration and self-discipline.
8. A not-so-fluent eloquence.
9. A not-so-bold personality.

Fortunately, I still have a passion for learning new knowledge. I hope to take advantage of my youth, while I still have a strong desire to learn, to learn more, try more and experience more. Because I know that the spirit of youth is something that is hard to be born with, and the moment I lose my desire to explore is the moment I approach the end of my life.

Today I have learnt something, such as the C++ implementation of the SA algo and relevant knowledge of multi-objective solving and Pareto optimization. If nothing was learnt today or nothing was learnt during the study period, I will be nervous, I often feel panicked, and my panic often turns into pessimism or loneliness. Sometimes I point the finger of evil at outside world, but more often I punish myself and grieve alone.

People are always willing to wallow in the feeling of pain rather than change their current situation, and they always hope someday there will be a person who understands all their pain and offers a helping hand selflessly. Actually no one will emerge unless they make changes by themselves. In society, men are not allowed to show their vulnerable side to the outside world, including to their parents and children, because no one will sympathize with a crying man, instead, they will avoid him. But for me, limited by my childhood, I need to spend more time than others to become a mature man.

When I was a child, I do not know why my parents were not afraid of death. Now I have realized that this might because they had witnessed too many dark sides of society, countless sad events and moments of helplessness. Compared to these, death seems to be a good ending (to put an end to the aforementioned pain). In contrast, some people live a stable and happy life throughout their lives, who often seek ways to increase the length of their lives or pursue an old age rather than an illness.

That is my twenties currently, repeatedly hearing two voices:

1. You will eventually succeed, but the prerequisite is that you need to find the right direction and keep working hard, blocking out external distractions. Only in this way can you have a relatively high salary level, quality of life, and social status in the future, become the so-called top person, and have the ability to form a highly educated family, raise children and achieve success, and enjoy your old age in peace.
2. Don't aim too high. Instead, you should recognize your own abilities. Let go of your useless obsessions and self-respect and be aware of that most efforts are in vain. Complete your studies and obtain a bachelor's degree, find a job, and then leave the rest to fate.

I also know that I don't need to be so pessimistic, because I'm studying CS, which offers relatively more job opportunities and higher salaries in the future. Besides, I have actually learned some content, and at present, I have project experience, some academic honors and a decent level of algorithm skills. But actually, all these are not enough to support me to live with dignity in the future, achieve financial freedom and have the ability to resist risks. Moreover, human desires are boundless.

A reason pushing me to prefer the first voice is that, until now, I still have not totally recovered from the immense grief of my failure in the CEE, and this incident has always been the trigger and enhancer of my pessimistic mood, which I have actually been trying every method to persuade myself that do not dive in. The huge pain does not only stem from my failure in the college entrance examination, but also from the major failure in filling out the college application form. This immense sadness, together, attacks my most vulnerable part, time and again, year after year. Ultimately, the frequency of my sadness gradually decreased because I knew that sadness was always in vain. For me, all I needed to do was to get into a decent university for a postgraduate degree, after when I would cut off these four years of undergraduate experience from my life like a tailor cutting the scraps of clothes. Perhaps this makes me seem too naive, as if academic qualifications are the ultimate goal in life. To some extent, I admit it. But I also believe that academic progress will definitely change my life.

Another reason is that I hope to find a more reliable lover in the future. It's not that I want to rely on her financially, but is to meet someone who shares the same interests. There are too many divorced men and women around me, most of who are my relatives and friends of my parents. The younger ones are in their twenties and the older ones are in their fifties. Actually many people are carried away by love and rush into marriage. Some brave people choose to divorce, while more choose to remain silent and live carelessly, deceiving themselves with the saying that love is mutual tolerance, but only daring to beg for that tiny bit of pitiful emotional value when their partners are in a good mood. This is the tragedy of the lower class, which don't even have the ability to get divorced, being afraid of change, pursuing stability and just muddling through life.

For these reasons, I must keep making progress until the day I lose my ability to learn.

P.S. To be honest, I no longer have any pure passion. My love for programming might simply be a yearning for high salaries.
