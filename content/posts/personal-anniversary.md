Two years ago today, I was drowning in the pain of my CEE scores -  far lower than expected. I had never exposed the pain to anyone except my promised lover.

After the CEE, I confessed my love to her. That's when I realize she had secretly been crushing on me for a whole year. She advocated we wait for a more better time to establish our romantic relationship - someday in the future, not then. I disagreed and tried to persuade her, and then she taught me a lesson of life that never to bind anyone in the name of love.
