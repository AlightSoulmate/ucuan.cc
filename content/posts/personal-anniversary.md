Two years ago today, I was going through a low point in my life. During that period, I was indulging in the pain of my CEE scores being far lower than expected, but I had never explosed my pain to anyone except my promised lover.

After the CEE, I confessed my love to her. It wasn't until then that I realized she had had a secret crush on me for one year. However, she advocated that we should establish a romantic relationship on a suitable day in the future, at least not at that time. I agreed.

Not long after, we fell apart. My once-promised lover became a thing of the past. That was exactly two years ago today, two days before my 19th birthday.

Perhaps you are confused by the reserved nature of traditional Chinese and Japanese people during their hormone-driven youth. This may be a stereotype about East Asia. Actually, Chinese people today are much more open-mind than decades ago. To me, being reserved in romantic relationships is more about personality than culture. Since I'm an introvert — my MBTI type is “I” — I tend to be more restrained, and this applies to people worldwide I thought.

I wonder if you have watched the Japanese film "Love Letter" and Hong Kong film "Comrades: Almost a Love Story". If haven't yet, it's a good choice to take a look.
