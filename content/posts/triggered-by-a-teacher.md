Afternoon on the way home, I suddenly realized I might can not eliminate some of my flaws completely throughout the lifetime. I am unsure whether this realization came too late and this thought didn’t come out of nowhere, it was triggered by one of my teachers.

What prompted this reflection was my teacher from the course *Microcomputer Principles*, the most straightforward teacher I've ever encountered. He always says that we students in this school are incompetent people. He is just like some arrogant middle-aged men I've met, but different from them in some ways. The first day I took his class, his words hurt me, because he was constantly picking at my wounds, and I had no way to defend myself.

I abhor many of his words, but there is one I agree with. He said we are not passionate people. For example, If he were to tell me face to face that I would be unable to complete a difficult task, I would remain silent instead of standing abruptly and insisting that I am capable of finishing it. I used to think keeping silent was a sign of contempt for someone else's words, but maybe I was wrong, or perhaps it was a form of weakness —— Actually I'm not sure.

……

I don't want to recall his other meaningless words again, and relive them and write them down again, which would make me uncomfortable over an d over again.

I think I should not accept my fate just in my 20s, as mentioned at the beginning "I realize that maybe I will never be able to change some flaws", or get rid of the influence of some flaws on me, because they have deeply affected me for nearly two decades. I don't tend to have a mindset of believing that effort is useless. Yet even with this belief, I repeatedly feel trapped in a dilemma — unsure how to make the right choice among the countless perspectives I have heard and contemplated about my own life. *I struggle between personal agency and a sense of existential inevitability.* What I can do now is only to study and live according to my plan and then intermittently fall into distress and confusion.
