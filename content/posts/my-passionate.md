Over the past two months, I have been deeply dedicated to improving my algorithmic problem-solving skills in preparation for ACM-style competitions.
 Although I am already a sophomore, I have not yet had the opportunity to participate in any ICPC contests. When I was a freshman, I participated in many competitions related to e-commerce, in which I won some notable awards.  Because I am busy with competitions and also serve in the student union, I hardly ever spend extra time on CS-self-studying. By the time I realized it, some of my classmates' algorithmics skills had far surpassed mine because they had won awards in ACM competitions. So I decided to start training by myself.

# LeetCode

In fact, before that, I had never seriously trained the algorithm.  After asking one of my classmates for advice, I decided to do LeetCode problems first, as each problem on it has an official solution and high-quality solutions released by experts, which is user-friendly for beginners.  I did exercises based on the knowledge points, practicing STL, sliding Windows, prefix sums and difference arrays, greed, graph theory, some commonly used mathematical formulas, and basic dynamic programming content.

# Codeforces & AtCoder

Later on, I started to get in touch with Codeforces and AtCoder, and I began to compete on these two platforms.  Competing on the OJ platform is different from solving problems on LeetCode.  The former adopts the ACM competition system so that after submitting a problem, one can only see whether it has passed or not and the type of error if it fails, but cannot know the specific error.

# Now

I still practice frequently as I plan to participate in the future ICPC.  At present, I engage in competitions on Codeforces while undergoing specialized training on LeetCode.  I think this is a great combination. I will train more attentively because I know I still have a long way to go to reach the ICPC level.

This is where my passionate for algorithm stands, though I am not sure how long I can maintain it. Over time, I've realized that what urges me to practice is not my passionate about the algorithm itself, but rather the competition and the recognition that follows.
